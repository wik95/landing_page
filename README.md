# landing_page

This is another project that I've had the pleasure of working on, on my TOP journey. The main goal is to be able to create a basic website from scratch. 

We we're encouraged to play around with the website and maybe even make up a fake company of our own. I jokingly came up with the idea of "chillax" - a company where the primary goal is to rest for those that don't have the time. After laying down the outline of the webpage, I allowed myself to add some images (which I downloaded, as instructed from pexels.com ) and change the colors a bit.
